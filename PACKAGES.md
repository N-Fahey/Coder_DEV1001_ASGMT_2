### License
The Apache license is largely similar to the MIT license in that it provides open use of the software, with one key difference being that if any modification has been made to the original source code, a notice of this modification must be included. In this instance the library is referenced only and unaltered, so no such notice is required. There are no conflicts between the MIT & Apache 2.0 license in this program.

# num2words
#### Taro Ogawa | Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
### Description
This small package allows for conversion between integers and string representations (e.g. 2 to Two), or to ordinal notation (e.g. 2 - 2nd) as used in this program.
### License
The LGPL license is slightly more restrictive than the above MIT & Apache 2.0 licenses. It requires inclusion of the original copyright notice, while also requiring release of source code when distributing work derived from the original library. There is also a requirement that derivative works be licensed under the same or similar license to this LGPL - however this does not apply in this instance where the library is dynamically linked and not bundled as part of a software release. As such, additional restrictions to not prohibit this program from being licensed under the MIT license or this library being referenced alongside MIT / Apache licensed libraries above.
